1b - Editor Setup
########################################


Goals
*********

* Get Atom set up as your editor.
  
  .. note:: For classes 1 - 9, we will be using Atom, which lets you edit plain text. Through there are various tools to make work easier, working in plain text will give you a better understanding of the subjects we will cover. You can choose to use other plain text tools, such as Sublime, Notepad, or Visual Studio Code, though I will not be providing support for those tools.
