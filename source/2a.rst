2a - HTML
############

Most of the content we deliver on line is in HTML.

In later lessons, we will use a variety of tools that make creating HTML easier.

Although these tools help us avoid the verbosity of HTML, it is very helpful
to know HTMl basics, which is why we start the course working directly with
HTML.

Assignment

|Assignment| 

Follow the GitHub flow to complete this assignment. After you fork the
repository, you can complete the assignment through the browser, or through
GitHub Desktop and Atom (or another text editor).

#. Make a fork of |Get Started HMTL Repo| in your own GitHub account.

#. Create a new branch to edit your repository.

#. In your new repository, edit the ``index.html`` file.

#. Give the page a title.

#. In the two ``article`` elements, add something about yourself, with a title
   and description.

#. In the first ``aside``, add a picture and description.
   
#. In the second ``aside``, add your favorite quotation.

#. Add an ``id`` attribute to each ``article`` element.

#. In the ``nav`` element, change the text of the link to match the article
   titles, and add links to each ID.

   For information on adding links to IDs, see |HMTL Links|.

#. Save the file, then open it in a browser and check it out.

#. Edit the file as needed, then view again. Keep repeating until you are
   satisfied.

View Your Work
****************

You now have a web page that you, and your friends and family, can view.

#. In the repository, open the **Settings** tab.

#. Find the **GitHub Pages** section.

#. For the **Source**, select **master branch**.
   
#. Click **Save**.

The URL of your new website is now listed. Open it.  If you don't like
something in your web page, edit the ``index.html`` file again.
