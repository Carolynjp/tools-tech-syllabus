#. Make a fork of |Get Started HMTL Repo| in your own GitHub account.

#. In your new repository, edit the index.html file.

#. Give the page a title.

#. In the two ``article`` elements, add something about yourself, with a title and description.

#. In the first ``aside``, add a picture and description.
   
#. In the second ``aside``, add your favorite quotation.

#. Add an ``id`` attribute to each ``article`` element.

#. In the ``nav`` element, change the text of the link to match the article titles, and add links to each ID.

   For information on adding links to IDs, see |HMTL Links|.

#. Save and commit the file to your ``master`` branch.

View Your Work

You now have a web page that you, and your friends and family, can view.

#. In the repository, open the **Settings** tab.

#. Find the **GitHub Pages** section.

#. For the **Source**, select **master branch**.
   
#. Click **Save**.

The URL of your new website is now listed. Open it.  If you don't like something in your web page, edit the ``index.html`` file again.
