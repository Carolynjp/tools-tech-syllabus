#. Use |Online reStructuredText Editor| to create a short version of your resume (or something else if your prefer). Share the link in |GitHub - Issues|.

#. Fork the |RST Templates Repository|.

#. Read all the files in the repository.

#. In your repository, use the templates to create a documentation set.

   Start with the ``topic.rst`` file. Use at least 2 levels of headings.

   Edit and rename files as needed.

   You should use at least:

   * 3 different pages.
   * One table, one numbered list, one unordered list.
   * One code block.
   * One external link.
   * One substitution.
   * Two different conditions.
   * One note and one caution.
