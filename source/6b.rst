|Assignment|

#. In the repository you made in :ref:`XML`, create a new branch.

#. Modify the XML file you created to be a valid DITA topic.

   You must decide what type of topic the content is:  **concept**, **task**, or **reference**.

   Then use valid elements for that type of topic.

#. Validate the file against the DTD for the topic type.

   .. note:: You must set the ``DOCTYPE`` declaration to the URL of the online DTD. Take a look at the sample files in the |Get Started with DITA repository|.
