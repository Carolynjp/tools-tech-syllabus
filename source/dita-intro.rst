DITA Introduction
###################

DITA stands for **Darwin Information Typing Architecture**.

* **Darwin** for the principles of specialization and inheritance. That is, users can evolve DITA for specific needs. (Not part of this class.)

* **Information typing** because each topic has a defined primary objective and structure.

* **Architecture** because DITA is an extensible set of structures.

Goals
*********

* Understand the philosophy and goals of DITA.

* Understand the basic DITA topic types: concept, task, reference.
