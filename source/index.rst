Tools and Technologies for Technical Writers
#####################################################

**Middlesex Community College**

This course will help you become familiar with a wide variety of current tools and technologies writers use to publish online content. 


Getting Started
******************

To get started, we will set up our content management system and an editor.  And we'll learn about HTML, which is the format in which we'll deliver all information.

Markup Languages
******************

Now that we've learned some HTML, it should be apparent that writing large volumes of content directly in HTML would not be efficient.  There are several markup languages that we can use to product HTML more easily.  We'll look at some of the most common.

Publishing Systems
*******************

There are many more robust publishing systems that we can use to develop content with more fine-grained control.  These programs offer more features and capabilities than markup languages, but also involved more overhead. We can still produce HTML, as well as some other formats.
