Final Project
#############

You will complete a final project for this course.

The project is to produce a substantial document through one of the tools we examine over the semester.

You are expected to hand in a proposal for the project by **class 7**, so we can discuss your plans.

I recommend doing the project in one of the markup Languages we work with in the first half of the course, for several reasons:

* You will have more time to apply what we learn. I expect that you will put substantial time into the project, and if you wait to use tools we cover near the end of the term, you will need to rush.

* Tools for using the markup languages we cover are free. You will not have to worry about licenses and trial periods.

* You will be able to use GitHub to manage your project, which will make it easy for me (and other students) to provide feedback, and for you to iterate through revisions using the GitHub Flow.

* Finally, I believe that the direct use of markup languages is a growing requirement for technical writers, and doing a substantial project that you can share and continue to enhance will help you in a job search.

Partners
**********

While you will complete your own project, you will have a partner. The partner's role is to provide feedback and help. You are free to share your work in progress with others in the class, but you must have at least one designated partner.

In addition, being a partner to another student will help you see project development from a different angle. You might think of things when looking at your partner's project that you would not see in your own work.

Finally, having a partner, or "peer editor" is something you'll have to do as a professional technical writer.
